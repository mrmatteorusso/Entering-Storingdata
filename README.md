# Entering-Storingdata
A prompt will request to enter data(in this case names) and when you hit enter or click "OK" when the prompt is empty, the script will print out as an alert the names entered in the array.

## Goal
The aim is to create a while loop and exit it through an if statement.

### Comments
Very interesting the challenge to translate into code a very neat idea in my mind...
